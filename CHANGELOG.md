**Version 1.2.1**

- Added a cell lists feature to optimize simulation performance;

- Added a backup feature to the simulation segment.

**Version 1.1.1**

- Improved readability of the code.

- The <code>Box/</code> subfolder is now a proper folder that holds information on box properties, such as dimensions, volume, and distortion. Valid only for the <i>NPT</i>-simulation. 

**Version 1.1.0**

- Fixed an issue when attempting to perform anisotropic volume changes;

- Added box distortion parameters and lattice reduction algorithms to prevent non-physical deformations of the simulation box (anisotropic only);

- Fixed the overlap check algorithm allowing overlapping configurations (the disk-rim test has been severely changed);

- Added an instruction which undoes any rotation of the simulation box after performing a lattice reduction;

- Added an option to enable the calculation of the intermolecular potential (perturbed system only). Molecular configurations are still defined by a purely repulsive hard-core potential;

- Added an overlap check between cylindrical and spherical particles;

- Spherical particles now must be properly identified by the user.

**Version 1.0.0**

- Creation of repository.
